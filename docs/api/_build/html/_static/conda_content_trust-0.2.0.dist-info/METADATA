# Conda Content Trust: Signing and verification tools for Conda

[![Tests (GitHub Actions)][ci-tests-badge]](https://github.com/conda/conda-content-trust/actions/workflows/tests.yml)
[![Codecov Status][codecov-badge]](https://codecov.io/gh/conda/conda-content-trust/branch/main)
[![latest release version][release-badge]](https://github.com/conda/conda-content-trust/releases)

*What:* Based on [The Update Framework (TUF)](https://theupdateframework.io/), conda-content-trust is intended to ensure that when users in the conda ecosystem obtain a package or data about that package, they can know whether or not it is trustworthy (e.g. originally comes from a reliable source and has not been tampered with).  A basic library and basic CLI are included to provide signing, verification, and trust delegation functionality.

*Why:* This exists as an alteration of TUF because of the very particular needs of the conda ecosystem.  (Developers are encouraged to *just use TUF* whenever possible!)

*Where:* This tool is general purpose.  It is currently used in conda 4.10.1+ to verify package metadata signatures when they are available ([announcement](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/conda-signature-verification), [instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda-commercial/security)).

## Installation

Installation can be accomplished via conda:

```
conda install conda-content-trust
```

Or via pip:

```
pip install conda-content-trust
```

(If you intend to tinker with the code, feel free to use an editable install: `pip install -e .`)

### Optional Dependencies for Producing Signatures with GPG Keys / YubiKeys

If you intend to *create* *GPG* key signatures (as opposed to the typical non-GPG signatures), and/or you intend to use the YubiKey interface, you will need to install two optional dependencies:

- `GPG` (any gpg client that provides command-line gpg functionality should do)
- `securesystemslib` (`pip install securesystemslib`)

## Demonstration and Use

Use of the command-line utility provides help functionality::

```
conda-content-trust --help
```

You should be able to run the demo after installing:

```
python3 demo.py
```

(Portions of the demo may require the optional dependencies above.)


## Testing

Each set of tests is a module in the `tests/` directory.  These can all be run with:

```
pytest
```
