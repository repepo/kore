## Installation

```bash
# Display information about current conda install
$ conda info

# Install conda-build in the base env
$ conda install -n base conda-build
```

## Building Your Own Packages

You can easily build your own packages for `conda`, and upload them to
[anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org), a free service for hosting packages for `conda`, as
well as other package managers. To build a package, create a recipe. See
[AnacondaRecipes](https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes) and [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge) for many example recipes, and
[`conda-build` documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/index.html) on how to build
recipes.

To upload to [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org), create an account.  Then, install the `anaconda-client`
and login

```bash
$ conda install anaconda-client
$ anaconda login
```

Then, after you build your recipe

```bash
$ conda build <RECIPE_DIR>
```

you will be prompted to upload to [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org).

To add your [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org) channel, or the channel of others to `conda` so that `conda install`
will find and install their packages, run

```bash
$ conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/<USERNAME>
```

(replacing `USERNAME` with the user name of the person whose channel you want
to add).

## Gotchas/FAQ

* `OSError: [Errno 36] File name too long:` - This error has been seen on Linux computers with encrypted folders. The solution is to install `miniconda` or `anaconda` to a location that is not encrypted. This error occurs because the encrypted form of the path that `conda-build` creates can be too long.
